# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Multi-Body Dynamics Research Group GitHub Profile!

## Who are we?

This team conducts research in Astrodynamics that includes investigations into both natural behavior and spacecraft motion: orbit dynamics, perturbations, and stability; trajectory control and on-orbit maneuvers; trajectory optimization and transfers; spacecraft formations; and, orbit determination and navigation. 
Various projects are ongoing. 
One particular focus is the study and impact of multiple gravitational fields on the motion of a body.
